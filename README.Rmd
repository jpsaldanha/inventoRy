# inventoRy (WORK IN PROGRESS)

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The  inventoRy package offers the conventional textbook expressions and nonparametric bootstrap
approaches for estimating inventory policy decisions such as the reorder point and safety stocks for single item inventories under the continuous review inventory policy using either the cycle service level or fill rate targets.

<!--The goal of inventoRy is to assist in estimate inventory parameters -- reorder point (ROP) and safety stock (ss) -- for the fill rate and service level customer service criterion under the continuous review inventory policy.
The primary purpose of this package is to provide non-paramteric bootstrap estimation functions for cases when the lead time demand (LTD) distribution takes on non-standard forms. Functions for standard forms are also provided including for uniform, lognormal, truncated-normal, etc. as an accompaniment of the Saldanha (2022) article.

# Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of inventoRy from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("inventoRy") -->
<!-- ``` -->

### install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jpsaldanha/inventoRy")

$\mu$

<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(inventoRy) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
