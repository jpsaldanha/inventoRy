\item{x}{vector of lead times}

\item{y}{time series of demands in the same unit of time as lead time}

\item{p2}{item's fill rate target proportion demand fulfilled from available stock}

\item{qty}{item's fixed order quantity}

\item{roptru}{if TRUE returns the ROP else SS, default is TRUE}

\item{p1}{the cycle service level as PNS}

\description{
This function uses the input of a vector of lead time and a vector of demand to calculate
the reorder point (ROP) or safety stock (SS) for a single inventory item with a P1
probability of stockout (PNS) under the (s, Q) inventory control policy using the gamma
approximation. The gamma approximation assumes that lead time demand is distributed according
to the gamma distribution. This function is available in popular textbooks e.g. Silver, Pyke
and Thomas (2016, 311-312).

This function uses the input of a vector of lead time and a vector of demand to calculate
the reorder point (ROP) or safety stock (SS) for a single inventory item with a P2
proportion of demand fulfilled from available stock fill rate under the (s, Q) inventory
control policy using the gamma approximation. The gamma approximation assumes that lead time
demand is distributed according to the gamma distribution. This function includes both the
approaches outlined by Silver (1970) when P2<=0.9 and P2>0.9. For P2>0.9 the approach was
derived by Tyworth, Guo, and Ganeshan (1996) and is also available in popular textbooks e.g.
 Silver, Pyke and Thomas (2016, 311-312). For P2<=0.9 see forthcoming paper by
 Saldanha (2021).

\details{
The output is the single inventory items' gamma ROP (s) if the roptru parameter is TRUE
or not entered (default) else if FALSE the SS for the target PNS P1 is returned.
The demand should be a time series vector in the same units of time as lead time e.g.
if lead times are in weeks time series of demand should be aggregated weekly .
